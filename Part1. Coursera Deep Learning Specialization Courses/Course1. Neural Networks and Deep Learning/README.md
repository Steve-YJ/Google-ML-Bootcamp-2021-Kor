## Week3. Shallow Neural Networks
> Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

* Describe hidden units and hidden layers
* Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
* Implement forward and backward propagation
* Apply random initialization to your neural network
* Increase fluency in Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
* Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
* Compute the cross entropy loss
