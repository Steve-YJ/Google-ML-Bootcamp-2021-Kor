## Week4. Deep Neural Networks
> Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks.
* Deep L-layer Neural Network
* Forward Propagation in a Deep Network
* Getting your Matrix Dimensions Right
* Why Deep Representations?
* Building Blocks of Deep Neural Networks
* Forward and Backward Propagation
* Parameters vs Hyperparameters
* What does this have to do with the brain?
